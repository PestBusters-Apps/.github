Pest Busters is a machine learning-based Mobile App for detecting pests on leafy vegetables, specifically designed to support hydroponic farming. By leveraging cutting-edge object detection models such as YOLO and TFOD, Pestbusters empowers farmers and enthusiasts to maintain healthy plants and maximise yields.

# Background

The Pest Busters app was developed to address the huge challenges faced by Indonesia's agriculture sector due to pest attacks that cause yield losses of up to 30% in leaf vegetables. By leveraging machine learning (ML) technology for pest identification through user-uploaded images, the app provides real-time treatment recommendations and personalized farming advice through a chatbot. Pest Busters also emphasizes reducing the use of chemical pesticides, promoting eco-friendly farming practices, and increasing productivity, thereby helping farmers reduce crop losses and contribute to sustainable farming practices.
